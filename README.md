# Langchain RAG system with Llama3.1-1B and ChromaDB

## Introduction
In this project, I have implemented a RAG system with Llama3.2-1b and ChromaDB. The RAG system is a system that can answer questions based on the given context. The RAG system is composed of three components: retriever, reader, and generator.
The retriever retrieves relevant documents from the given context. The reader reads the retrieved documents and generates the answer. The generator generates the answer based on the retrieved documents and the answer generated by the reader. In this project, I have used Llama3.1 as the retriever and ChromaDB as the reader. Llama3.1 retrieves the relevant documents from the given context and the ChromaDB reads the retrieved documents and generate the answer. The RAG system is implemented in Python.
